ðŸ“˜ Chapter 3: Python Data Structures

Python has 5 main built-in collections: String, List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary.
Each has its own features.

String - Immutable sequence of characters.
Strings support indexing and slicing.
Example: my_string = "Hello, World!"

List - Mutable sequence of items.
Lists can contain mixed data types.
Lists support indexing, slicing, and various methods like append(), remove(), and sort().
Example: my_list = [1, "two", 3.0, [4, 5]]

Tuple - Immutable sequence of items.
Tuples can also contain mixed data types.
Tuples support indexing and slicing.
Example: my_tuple = (1, "two", 3.0, (4, 5))

Set - Unordered collection of unique items.
Sets are mutable and support operations like union, intersection, and difference.
Example: my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Dictionary - Mutable collection of key-value pairs.
Dictionaries are unordered and indexed by keys.
Example: my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city
": "New York"}

Each data structure has its own use cases and advantages. Understanding these will help you choose the right one for your needs in Python programming.
